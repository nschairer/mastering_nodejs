How does the web work?

User client -> enters url -> domain lookup for server -> request to server

node.js runs on server which has the ip address the client makes a req too

server sends a response -- HTML,JSON,XML etc. pretty much anything


Standardized way of communicating in the internet
- HTTP - hyper text transfer protocol
      - standard for transferring data understood by browser and server
- HTTPS - HTTP Secure
        - Adds data encryption during transmission
